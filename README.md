A Discord bot created with Discord.js/Node.js, based off of my character Ceranita.

Various values are based off of environment variables- a template file environmentVarsTEMPLATE.env is included, and must be renamed to environmentVars.env in order to function locally.
Hosting services, like Heroku, shouldn't require this file and have different means to set up environment variables. Required variables are visible in the template file.
